Story Pitch
There are many things that you have to keep in mind while driving a car. You must pay attention to your own actions, yes, but you must also pay attention to the road and the other cars around you and the conditions and the weather. Where I grew up, my high school was right by the river so the road flooded often. One time I did not see the floodwater until it was too late and I hydroplaned. I had zero control and all I could do was keep driving forward. Luckily there were no other cars around me, but if there were it couldâ€™ve been very bad. About 4700 people die each year due to hydroplaning and I am lucky that it was not me. That road stayed flooded for about a week and I had to completely change my route to avoid it and stay safe. I also completely refuse to drive in the snow and so do my parents, including my father who grew up in Montreal and grew up in it, just due to the fact that it makes everything so unpredictable and hard to control, with driving being scary enough as it is. These are some more obvious examples of weather conditions but we also want to look at less obvious examples of weather affecting driving. One thing that I grew up being taught that I never would have thought of on my own is to be careful the first day that it rains after it has not rained for a while. This is because the oil on the road is brought up and it makes the road extra slippery. Another thing is that people are going to drive more carelessly on a sunny day, especially when it is the first sunny day of the year as they are feeling the sun and the breeze and taking that in and focusing less on the road. Where I grew up it was a rural area with lots of open empty roads that were fun to drive on and every summer you would see sports cars zooming down the road faster than the speed limit when it was sunny and I always had to be careful as they would also usually often pass other cars by driving on the wrong side of the road just because they could. With these datasets, we want to figure out exactly what patterns in weather correlate with accidents, especially in an area that we are less familiar with as this can help people be safer and know when to be extra vigilant on the road. It will also be interesting to see what times of year and day accidents are the most common.

background research:
https://weather.com/news/weather/video/freezing-fog-rain-likely-cause-of-30-car-crash-in-washington-state
This is a news report of December 19, 2022 in Washington State. In this event, freezing fog leads to the car crashes of 30 cars. In this case, we are sharing the same topic, which is the correlation between weather and car crashes.
This news report is only about the facts, but our research will dive deeper into it.
https://www.fox4news.com/news/dallas-weather-roads-icy-traffic-conditions
This news report is about icy road causing car crashes in North Taxes, but our research subject is about weather and car accidents in Maryland.
Our research is about various weathers that will lead to the car accidents, but only about cold icy weather
https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/q1_roadimpact.htm
This is a systematic research about roadway impact and weather, which is very close to our topic.
However, their research is more inclined to scientific things, such as humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, but our research is about some general weather, such as fog, and rainstorm
https://www.lorenzoandlorenzo.com/personal-injury-guide/bad-weather-car-accidents/
This is an article that talks about statistics, causes, and aftermaths of car accidents of weather effects. Our main topic is the same.
However, in our research, we are only considering the correlation between weather and car incidents, not about stats and aftermaths.
https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/4-officers-injured-in-maryland-heights-crash/
This is also about car accident caused by weather in Maryland, which is the same as our research subject
This is just a news report, but our core of research is the correlation between the weather and the car accidents.
